this paper proves that several interactive proof systems are zero-knowledge against general quantum attacks. this includes the well-known goldreich-micali-wigderson classical zero-knowledge protocols for graph isomorphism and graph 3-coloring (assuming the existence of quantum computationally concealing commitment schemes in the second case). also included is a quantum interactive protocol for a complete problem for the complexity class of problems having "honest verifier" quantum statistical zero-knowledge proofs, which therefore establishes that honest verifier and general quantum statistical zero-knowledge are equal: qszk = qszkhv. previously no non-trivial proof systems were known to be zero-knowledge against quantum attacks, except in restricted settings such as the honest-verifier and common reference string models. this paper therefore establishes for the first time that true zero-knowledge is indeed possible in the presence of quantum information and computation.
