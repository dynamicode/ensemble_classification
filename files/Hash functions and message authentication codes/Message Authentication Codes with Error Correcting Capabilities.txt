in this paper, we propose classes of message authentication codes (mac) based on error correcting-codes. we introduce a new notion of error tolerant forgery of hash messages. these macs allow full error recovery for all applications, while being error-tolerant for less information-sensitive applications. the classes of the keyed hash functions are highly secure, and provide the capabilities of correcting errors on transmission, including burst-errors, which is a typical phenomenon in wireless communications. these classes of hash functions are easily implementable in hardware by means of simple linear feedback shift register structures.
