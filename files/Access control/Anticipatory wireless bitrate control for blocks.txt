we present blockrate, a wireless bitrate adaptation algorithm designed for blocks, or large contiguous units of transmitted data, as opposed to small packets. in contrast to state-of-the-art algorithms that can either have the amortization benefits of blocks or high responsiveness to underlying channel conditions of packets, blockrate has both. our evaluation shows that blockrate achieves up to 2.8&#215; goodput improvement in a variety of mobility scenarios.
