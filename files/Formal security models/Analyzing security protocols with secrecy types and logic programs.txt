we study and further develop two language-based techniques for analyzing security protocols. one is based on a typed process calculus; the other, on untyped logic programs. both focus on secrecy properties. we contribute to these two techniques, in particular by extending the former with a flexible, generic treatment of many cryptographic operations. we also establish an equivalence between the two techniques.
