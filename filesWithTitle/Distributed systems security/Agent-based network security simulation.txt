we present nessi2, the network security simulator, a simulation environment that is based on the service-centric agent platform jiac. it focuses on network security-related scenarios such as attack analysis and evaluation of counter-measures. we introduce the main nessi2 concepts and discuss the motivation for realizing them with agent technology. then, we present the individual components and examples where nessi2 has been successfully applied.agent-based network security simulation
