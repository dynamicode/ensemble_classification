appliance load monitoring systems aim to achieve per appliance energy decomposition. such systems however lack automated set-up, which precludes widespread roll-outs. this work illustrates how human supervision can be reduced to a strict minimum; appliance activity states are captured with cheap wireless sensors, which enables accurate automated energy data annotation. this paper demonstrates the accuracy of this technique via an intuitive graphical user interface.appliance activity monitoring using wireless sensors
