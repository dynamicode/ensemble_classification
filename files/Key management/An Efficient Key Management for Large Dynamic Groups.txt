key management for large dynamic groups is adifficult problem because of scalability and security.skdc method is very weak in scalability. logical keyhierarchy (lkh) algorithm proposed in 1997 has greatlyimproved scalability for key management in largedynamic groups. in 1998 one-way-function tree (oft)method appeared to obtain more efficiency than lkh. butoft method has security breaches in collusion attacks. inthis paper a new method will be presented, which is moreefficient than oft and resistant to collusion attacks.
