this paper discusses the financial benefit of intrusion detection systems (ids) deployment techniques and addresses the problems of bridging the gap between technical security solutions and the business need for it. this is an area of interest to both the research and the business community; most idses balance host and network monitoring, but the decision about how to adjust usage of each technique tends to be made in a rather ad-hoc way, or based upon effectiveness of detection only without regard to cost of technique. in practice, selections based on how well a strategy helps a company to perform are preferable and methodologies supporting a selection process of this type will assist an information technology officer to explain security mechanism selections more effectively to ceos. in this context, the approach we propose could be applied when choosing one intrusion detection system over another based on which has a better or higher return on investment for the company.through a case study, we illustrate the benefits of a better ids management that leads to a positive return on investment (roi) for ids deployment. we conceive strategies and approaches to support effective decision-making about which techniques are appropriate for the cost effective management of the ids in a given environment. it is our intent that this research will serve as a foundation for the formal description of cost structures, analysis, and selection of effective implementation approaches to support the management of ids deployments.
