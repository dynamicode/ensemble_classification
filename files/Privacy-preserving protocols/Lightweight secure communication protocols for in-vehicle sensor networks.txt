wireless sensor networks are increasingly being integrated into the modern automobile with the intention of improving safety and reducing costs. however, it has been shown that the first widely-deployed and mandatory in-car sensor networks --tire pressure monitoring systems (tpmss) -- employ no cryptographic algorithms for protecting their wireless communication, incurring serious security and privacy risks for consumers. in this paper, we design and evaluate cost-effective secure communication protocols that can resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities of existing tpmss as well as other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks. our implementation on arduino platforms shows that the proposed protocol incurs modest overhead and is applicable to resource-constrained embedded systems.
