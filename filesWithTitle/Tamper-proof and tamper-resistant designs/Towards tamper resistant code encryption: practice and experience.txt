in recent years, many have suggested to apply encryption in the domain of software protection against malicious hosts. however, little information seems to be available on the implementation aspects or cost of the different schemes. this paper tries to fill the gap by presenting our experience with several encryption techniques: bulk encryption, an on-demand decryption scheme, and a combination of both techniques. our scheme offers maximal protection against both static and dynamic code analysis and tampering. we validate our techniques by applying them on several benchmark programs of the cpu2006 test suite. and finally, we propose a heuristic which trades off security versus performance, resulting in a decrease of the runtime overhead.towards tamper resistant code encryption: practice and experience
