computational e-mail systems, which allow mail messages to contain command scripts that automatically execute upon receipt, can be used as a basis for building a variety of collaborative applications. however, their use also presents a serious security problem because a command script from a sender may access/modify receiver's private files or execute applications on receiver's behalf. existing solutions to the problem either severely restrict i/o capability of scripts, limiting the range of applications that can be supported over computational e-mail, or permit all i/o to scripts, potentially compromising the security of the receiver's files. our model, called the intersection model of security, permits i/o for e-mail from trusted senders but without compromising the security of private files. we describe two implementations of our security model: an interpreter-level implementation and an operating systems-level implementation. we discuss the tradeoffs between the two implementations and suggest directions for future work.
