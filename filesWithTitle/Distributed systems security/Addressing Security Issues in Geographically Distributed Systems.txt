using our alchemy research system as an exemplarsystem, we discuss different approaches to overcomingport-controlled security boundary limitations togeographically distributed computing environments whilemaintaining the inherent security provided by theseboundaries. this discussion is relevant to a number ofparallel/distributed strategies for grid and clusterarchitectures. it also provides insight into generalsecurity concerns in future distributed computingnetworks and how these may best be overcome.addressing security issues in geographically distributed systems
