the contribution of this paper is a mechanism which links authentication to audit using weak identities and takes identity out of the trust management envelope. although our protocol supports weaker versions of anonymity it is still useful even if anonymity is not required, due to the ability to reduce trust assumptions which it provides. we illustrate the protocol with an example of authorization in a role based access mechanism.
