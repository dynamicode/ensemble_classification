in this paper, we propose a metabolic computing model for realizing a sustainable information system. we think that this metabolic computing model has both high fault tolerance and sustainability. we also propose a realistic architecture of the metabolic computing model. a metaboloid is a processing unit in this architecture. a set of metaboloids is organized as a mesh-connected norma (no remote memory access). however, the network may change because of metabolism. therefore, metaboloids have to achieve homeostasis to manage running tasks. we propose two new algorithms in this paper, namely bubbling and drifting.metabolic computing
