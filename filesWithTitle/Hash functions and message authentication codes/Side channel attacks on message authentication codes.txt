side channel attacks are a serious menace to embedded devices with cryptographic applications which are utilized in sensor and ad hoc networks. in this paper we show that side channel attacks can be applied to message authentication codes, even if the countermeasure is applied to the underlying block cipher. in particular, we show that emac, omac, and pmac are vulnerable to our attack. based on simple power analysis, we show that several key bits can be extracted, and based on differential power analysis, we present selective forgery against these macs. our results suggest that protecting block ciphers against side channel attacks is not sufficient, and countermeasures are needed for macs as well.side channel attacks on message authentication codes
