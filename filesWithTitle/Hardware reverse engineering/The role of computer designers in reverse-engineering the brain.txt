a truly grand challenge for science in general, and for computer architects and designers in particular, is to understand the mammalian brain's computing paradigm and then construct a computing device that embodies that paradigm. although computer designers have a potential role to play in solving this grand challenge, it is up to us to define that role. from a computer designer's perspective, i will illustrate the current understanding of the brain's computational paradigm by describing several examples from experimental neuroscience. i will suggest an architecture hierarchy and discuss issues that arise when translating from the complex, asynchronous, electro-chemical device, which is the brain, to a synchronous digital device capable of performing computation in a similar manner. this translation presents many difficult challenges that will require science-inspired insight and discovery, added to the challenges of engineering a very large, unconventional digital system. but, as difficult as they may be, these challenges provide almost unlimited opportunities for forward-looking, risk-taking computer architects and designers.the role of computer designers in reverse-engineering the brain
