in this paper, we introduce argumentation frameworks with necessities (afns), an extension of dung's argumentation frameworks (afs) taking into account a necessity relation as a kind of support relation between arguments (an argument is necessary for another). we redefine the acceptability semantics for these extended frameworks and we show how the necessity relation allows a direct and easy correspondence between a fragment of logic programs (lps) and afns. we introduce then a further generalization of afns that extends the necessity relation to deal with sets of arguments. we give a natural adaptation of the acceptability semantics to this new context and show that the generalized frameworks allow to encode arbitrary logic programs.argumentation frameworks with necessities
