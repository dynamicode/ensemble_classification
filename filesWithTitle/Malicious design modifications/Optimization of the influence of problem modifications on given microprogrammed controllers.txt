for the logic design of digital controllers, efficient synthesis algorithms have been published. most of these assume, that a completely new hardware consisting of the fewest number of components has to be built. the implementation of those algorithms form an important part of a cad system for logic design. in order to be accepted in practice, a cad system has to take into account additional requirements. one of these concerns with the minimization of hardware changes caused by subsequent modifications of the control task which often become necessary after the completion of the hardware implementation. this paper describes a method which solves this problem for an universal structure of microprogrammed controllers. this method is implemented as a module of the cad program system loge. loge supports the logic design of hardwired, microprogrammed, and microprocessor based controllers. loge already proved to be a powerful design tool in several industrial applications.optimization of the influence of problem modifications on given microprogrammed controllers
