an important aspect of trust in cloud computing consists in preventing the cloud provider from misusing the user's data. in this work-in-progress paper, we propose the approach of data anonymization to solve this problem. as this directly leads to problems of cloud usage accounting, we also propose a solution for anonymous yet reliable access control and accountability based on ring and group signatures.towards an anonymous access control and accountability scheme for cloud computing
