a method of integrating user authentication with anonymity and untraceability is presented based on the secret-key certificate and the algebraic structure of error-correcting codes. authentication protocol proposed here provides a means for the authentication server to avoid the requirement of maintaining a secure database of user secrets. especially, since the proposed protocol uses a symmetric-key cryptography and eliminates the key management problem, it is efficient and convenient for both the hardware-limited users and the authentication server.
