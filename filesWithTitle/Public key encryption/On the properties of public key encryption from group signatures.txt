in this talk, we discuss properties of public key encryption schemes which are derived from group signatures. abdalla and warinschi (icics 2004) and ohtake et al. (africacrypt 2009) already showed that it is possible to construct a chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption from an arbitrary group signature scheme in a black-box manner. by extending these results, we further show that if the underlying group signature scheme has some special property, then its converted public key encryption scheme also yields a special property which is inherited from the underlying group signature.on the properties of public key encryption from group signatures
