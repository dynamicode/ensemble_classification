there are many variants of the original self-organizing neural map algorithm proposed by kohonen. one of the most recent is the evolving tree, a tree-shaped self-organizing network which has many interesting characteristics. this network builds a tree structure splitting the input dataset during learning. this paper presents a speed-up modification of the original training algorithm useful when the evolving tree network is used with complex data as images or video. after a measurement of the effectiveness an application of the modified algorithm in image segmentation is presented.evolving tree algorithm modifications
