content-dependent access control, where the access decisions depend upon the value of an attribute of the object itself, is required in many applications. however problems arise in an object-based environment, because obtaining the value of an object's attribute requires an operation upon the object. we discuss the conceptual and performance implications of introducing content-dependent access control, and suggest how the problems can be avoided in some cases by using a domain-based approach to access control.
