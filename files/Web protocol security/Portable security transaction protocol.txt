the portal security transaction protocol (pstp) is a new signature technology that adds signature semantics to one-time password technology. pstp was developed to secure transactions in the financial services industry; however, pstp may be applicable to signatures in other spaces. pstp technology provides high signature strength of mechanism without requiring asymmetric key pairs deployed to client machines. pstp provides cryptographic after-the-fact evidence of a transaction event in a secured log.
