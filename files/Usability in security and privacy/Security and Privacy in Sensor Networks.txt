sensor networks offer economically viable solutions for a variety of applications. for example, current implementations monitor factory instrumentation, pollution levels, free-way traffic, and the structural integrity of buildings. other applications include climate sensing and control in office buildings and home environmental sensing systems for temperature, light, moisture, and motion.
