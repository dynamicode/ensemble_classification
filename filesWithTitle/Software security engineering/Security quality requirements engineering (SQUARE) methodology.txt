requirements engineering, a vital component in successful project development, often neglects sufficient attention to security concerns. further, industry lacks a useful model for incorporating security requirements into project development. studies show that upfront attention to security saves the economy billions of dollars. industry is thus in need of a model to examine security and quality requirements in the development stages of the production lifecycle.in this paper, we examine a methodology for both eliciting and prioritizing security requirements on a development project within an organization. we present a model developed by the software engineering institute's networked systems survivability (nss) program, and then examine two case studies where the model was applied to a client system. the nss program continues to develop this useful model, which has proven effective in helping an organization understand its security posture.security quality requirements engineering (square) methodology
