we propose several new methods to protect the scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve against differential analysis. the basic idea consists in transforming the curve through various random morphisms to provide a non-deterministic execution of the algorithm. the solutions we suggest complement and improve the state-of-the-art, but also provide a practical toolbox of efficient countermeasures. these should suit most of the needs for protecting implementations of crypto-algorithms based on elliptic curves.
