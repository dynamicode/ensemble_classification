we present template attacks, the strongest form of side channel attack possible in an information theoretic sense. these attacks can break implementations and countermeasures whose security is dependent on the assumption that an adversary cannot obtain more than one or a limited number of side channel samples. they require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. the success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. in contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. we describe in detail how an implementation of rc4, not amenable to techniques such as spa and dpa, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. other applications include attacks on certain des implementations which use dpa-resistant hardware and certain ssl accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an rsa operation even from distances of fifteen feet.template attacks
