in this paper we describe our general framework for usage control (ucon) enforcement on grid systems. it allows both grid services level enforcement of ucon as well as fine-grained one at the level of local grid node resources. in addition, next to the classical checks for usage control: checks of conditions, authorizations, and obligations, the framework also includes trust and risk management functionalities. indeed, we show how trust and risk issues naturally arise when considering usage control in grid systems and services and how our architecture is flexible enough to accommodate both notions in a pretty uniform way.
