we discuss the security of message authentication code (mac) schemes from the viewpoint of differential attack, and propose an attack that is effective against des-mac and feal-mac. the attack derives the secret authentication key in the chosen plaintext scenario. for example, des(8-round)-mac can be broken with 234 pairs of plaintext, while feal8-mac can be broken with 222 pairs. the proposed attack is applicable to any mac scheme, even if the 32-bits are randomly selected from among the 64-bits of ciphertext generated by a cryptosystem vulnerable to differential attack in the chosen plaintext scenario.differential attack on message authentication codes
