there are a number of critical factors driving security in web engineering. these include: economic issues, people issues, and legislative issues. this paper presents the argument that a security improvement approach (sia), which can be applied to different web engineering development processes, is essential to successfully addressing web application security. in this paper, the criteria that any sia will have to address, for a web engineering process, are presented. the criteria are derived with supporting empirical evidence based on an in-depth security survey conducted within a fortune 500 financial service sector organization and supporting literature. the contribution of this paper is two fold. the criteria presented in this paper can be used to assess the security of an existing web engineering process and also to guide security improvement initiatives in web engineering.
