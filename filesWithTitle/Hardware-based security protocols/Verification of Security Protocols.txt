security protocols are short programs aiming at securing communications over a network. they are widely used in our everyday life. they may achieve various goals depending on the application: confidentiality, authenticity, privacy, anonymity, fairness, etc. their verification using symbolic models has shown its interest for detecting attacks and proving security properties. a famous example is the needham-schroeder protocol [23] on which g. lowe discovered a flaw 17 years after its publication [20]. secrecy preservation has been proved to be co-npcomplete for a bounded number of sessions [24], and decidable for an unbounded number of sessions under some additional restrictions (&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; . [3,12,13,25]). many tools have also been developed to automatically verify cryptographic protocols like [8,21]. verification of security protocols
