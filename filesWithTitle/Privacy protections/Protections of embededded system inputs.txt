the paper reveals the solution for the protection of inputs and outputs of embedded systems and their mathematical description. these are the problems of galvanic separation, restrictions disturbing voltage, limit reduction of signals and signal verification of loaded value. they dealt galvanic isolators and limiters limit on another principle. the work compares different methods of input and output. another part is a summary of methods for operations related to the evaluation of the accuracy of the capture inputs before further processing. other parts of the thesis is a mathematical description of the behavior of protection of inputs and outputs. to find the causes of nonlinearity limit limiters and analog galvanic isolators. the linear optocouplers are designed to the partial non-linearity caused by the method used and participation components. the research work was performed to financial support of grant reg. no iga/32/fai/11/d.protections of embededded system inputs
