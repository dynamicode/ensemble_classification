we present a recursive algorithm to update a kripke model so as to satisfy a formula of the computation-tree logic (ctl). recursive algorithms for model update face a difficulty: deleting (adding) transitions from (to) a kripke model to satisfy a universal (an existential) subformula may dissatisfy some existential (universal) subformulas. our method employs protected models to overcome this difficulty. we demonstrate our algorithm with a classical example of automatic synthesis described by emerson and clarke in 1982. from a dummy model, where the accessibility relation is the identity relation, our algorithm can efficiently generate a model to satisfy a specification of mutual exclusion in a variant of ctl. such a variant extends ctl with an operator that limits the out-degree of states. we compare our method with a generateand-test algorithm and outline a proof of soundness and completeness for our method.
