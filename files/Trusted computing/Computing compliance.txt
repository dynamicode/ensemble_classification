inquisitive semantics (cf. groenendijk, 2008) provides a formal framework for reasoning about information exchange. the central logical notion that the semantics gives rise to is compliance. this paper presents an algorithm that computes the set of compliant responses to a given initiative. the algorithm is sound and complete. the implementation is accessible online via www.illc.uva.nl/inquisitive-semantics.
