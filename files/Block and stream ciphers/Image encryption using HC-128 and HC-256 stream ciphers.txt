in this paper, we surveyed hc-128 and hc-256 as methods for protecting the distribution of digital images in an efficient and secure way. we proposed the hongjun cipher (hc) image encryption algorithm based on column-wise raster scanning of the plain image. then, we performed a series of tests and some comparisons to justify the efficiency of surveyed algorithms for image encryption. these tests included key space analysis, visual test and histogram analysis, randomness analysis, information entropy, encryption quality, correlation analysis, differential analysis, sensitivity analysis and performance analysis. based on all analysis and experimental results, it can be concluded that the two variants of hc scheme are efficient, feasible and trustworthy to be adopted for image encryption.
