as companies move towards many-core chips, an efficient on-chip communication fabric to connect these cores assumes critical importance. to address limitations to wire delay scalability and increasing bandwidth demands, state-of-the-art on-chip networks use a modular packet-switched design with routers at every hop which allow sharing of network channels over multiple packet flows. this, however, leads to packets going through a complex router pipeline at every hop, resulting in the overall communication energy/delay being dominated by the router overhead, as opposed to just wire energy/delay.token flow control
