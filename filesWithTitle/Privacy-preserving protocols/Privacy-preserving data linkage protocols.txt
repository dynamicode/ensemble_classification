we address the problem of data linkage and data extraction across database tables of sensitive information about individuals, in an environment of constraints on organisations' ability to share data and a need to protect individuals' privacy and confidentiality. we propose several privacy-preserving data linkage and data extraction protocols. our first protocol enables data linkage across separate database tables, without requiring any identifying information to be revealed to any party outside the originating data source. our second protocol enables the extraction of a cohort of individuals' data from a data source, without revealing the membership of any individual in that cohort to the data source. we describe a variation of the first protocol which enables data sources to generate common pseudonyms without revealing any identifying information to any party, and show how the protocols are applicable for any number of data sources.privacy-preserving data linkage protocols
