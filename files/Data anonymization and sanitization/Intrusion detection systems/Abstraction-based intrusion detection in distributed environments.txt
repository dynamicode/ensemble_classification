abstraction is an important issue in intrusion detection, since it not only hides the difference between heterogeneous systems, but also allows generic intrusion-detection models. however, abstraction is an error-prone process and is not well supported in current intrusion-detection systems (idss). this article presents a hierarchical model to support attack specification and event abstraction in distributed intrusion detection. the model involves three concepts: system view, signature, and view definition. a system view provides an abstract interface of a particular type of information; defined on the instances of system views, a signature specifies certain distributed attacks or events to be monitored; a view definition is then used to derive information from the matches of a signature and presents it through a system view. with the three elements, the model provides a hierarchical framework for maintaining signatures, system views, as well as event abstraction. as a benefit, the model allows generic signatures that can accommodate unknown variants of known attacks. moreover, abstraction represented by a system view can be updated without changing either its specification or the signatures specified on its basis. this article then presents a decentralized method for autonomous but cooperative component systems to detect distributed attacks specified by signatures. specifically, a signature is decomposed into finer units, called detection tasks, each of which represents the activity to be monitored on a component system. the component systems (involved in a signature) then perform the detection tasks cooperatively according to the "dependency" relationships among these tasks. an experimental system called cards has been implemented to test the feasibility of the proposed approach.
