commerce is a rapidly emerging application area of ubiquitous computing. in this paper, we discuss the market forces that make the deployment of ubiquitous commerce infrastructures a priority for grocery retailing. we then proceed to report on a study on consumer perceptions of mygrocer, a recently developed ubiquitous commerce system. the emphasis of the discussion is on aspects of security, privacy protection and the development of trust; we report on the findings of this study. we adopt the enacted view of technology adoption to interpret some of our findings based on three principles for the development of trust. we expect that this interpretation can help to guide the development of appropriate strategies for the successful deployment of ubiquitous commerce systems.
