we propose a method for dynamic security-domain scaling on smps that offers both highly scalable performance and high security for future high-end embedded systems. its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security-domain (i.e., dynamically yielding processors to other security-domains) in response to application load requirements. two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. the increase in oss in binary code size is less than 1.5&percnt;, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond. this scaling is the first in the world to make possible the dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security-domain on an arm smp.dynamic security domain scaling on embedded symmetric multiprocessors
