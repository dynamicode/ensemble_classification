this paper introduces an asynchronous optimistic certified email protocol, with stateless recipients, that relies on key chains to considerably reduce the storage requirements of the trusted third party. the proposed protocol thereby outperforms the existing schemes that achieve strong fairness. the paper also discusses the revocation of compromised keys as well as practical considerations regarding the implementation of the protocol.a certified email protocol using key chains
