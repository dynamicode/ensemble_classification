py and pypy are efficient array-based stream ciphers designed by biham and seberry. both were submitted to the estream competition. this paper shows that py and pypy are practically insecure. if one key is used with about 216ivs with special differences, with high probability two identical keystreams will appear. this can be exploited in a key recovery attack. for example, for a 16-byte key and a 16-byte iv, 223chosen ivs can reduce the effective key size to 3 bytes. for a 32-byte key and a 32-byte iv, the effective key size is reduced to 3 bytes with 224chosen ivs. py6, a variant of py, is more vulnerable to these attacks.differential cryptanalysis of the stream ciphers py, py6 and pypy
