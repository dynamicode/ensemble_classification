this paper considers and validates the applicability of leveraging pervasively-available performance counters for detecting and reasoning about security breaches. our key observation is that many security breaches, which typically cause abnormal control flow, usually incur precisely identifiable deviation in performance samples captured by processors. based on this observation, we implement a prototype system called eunomia, which is the first non-intrusive system that can detect emerging attacks based on return-oriented programming without any changes to applications (either source or binary code) or special-purpose hardware. our security evaluation shows that eunomia can detect some realistic attacks including code-injection attacks, return-to-libc attacks and return-oriented programming attacks on unmodified binaries with relatively low overhead.
