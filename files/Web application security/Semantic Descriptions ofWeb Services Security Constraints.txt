non-functional descriptions of web services and busi- ness rules play an important role in specification and analy- sis of the security constraints of web services. as existing approaches do not provide logic and semantic model for the web services security constraints, sharing and reason- ing over them are infeasible. the proposal builds upon the project akt's1 work in defining a semantic web constraint interchange format (cif), which itself builds on the pro- posed semantic web rule language (swrl). the main contributions of this paper are a new ontology for representing security constraints as policy and a seman- tic policy framework for the management of the policies; we also show the possibility to integrate the business rules and non-functional descriptions into policy specification by means of converting them into constraint satisfaction prob- lem (csp) using cif.
