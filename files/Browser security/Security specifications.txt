this paper gives a security and specification-oriented semantics for systems. the semantic model is derived from that for the trace model of hoare's communicating sequential processes[ho85] and is used to define various security concepts, such as multi-level secure system, trusted users and integrity. we indicate how implementations of secure systems may be derived from their specifications.
