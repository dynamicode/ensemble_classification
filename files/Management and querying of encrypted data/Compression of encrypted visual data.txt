chaotic mixing based encryption schemes for visual data are shown to be robust to lossy compression as long as the security requirements are not too high. this property facilitates the application of these ciphers in scenarios where lossy compression is applied to encrypted material &#8211; which is impossible in case traditional ciphers should be employed. if high security is required chaotic mixing loses its robustness to compression, still the lower computational demand may be an argument in favor of chaotic mixing as compared to traditional ciphers when visual data is to be encrypted.
