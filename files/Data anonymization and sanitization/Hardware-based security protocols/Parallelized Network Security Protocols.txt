security and privacy are growing concerns in the internet community, due to the internet's rapid growth and the desire to conduct business over it safely. this desire has led to the advent of several proposals for security standards, such as secure ip, secure http, and the secure socket layer. all of these standards propose using cryptographic protocols such as des and rsa. thus, the need to use encryption protocols is increasing.shared-memory multiprocessors make attractive server platforms, for example as secure world-wide web servers. these machines are becoming more common, as shown by recent vendor introductions of platforms such as sgi's challenge, sun's sparccenter, and dec's alphaserver. the spread of these machines is due both to their relative ease of programming and their good price/performance.this paper is an experimental performance study that examines how encryption protocol performance can be improved by using parallelism. we show linear speedup for several different internet-based cryptographic protocol stacks running on a symmetric shared-memory multiprocessor using two different approaches to parallelism.
