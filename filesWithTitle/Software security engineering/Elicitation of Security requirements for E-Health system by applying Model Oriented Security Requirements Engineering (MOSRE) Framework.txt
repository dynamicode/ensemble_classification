e-health is a health care system which is supported by electronic process and communication. the information that is kept in the system must be accurate. in case of false information, it may cause harm to human life. so this system needs more security to protect the credential information. e-health system is the most security sensitive process handled electronically. the highest achievable security is never too much for an e-health system. so when system is being built, tasks such as security requirements elicitation, specification and validation are essential to assure the quality of the resulting secure e-health system. by considering the security requirements as functional requirements in the requirement phase, the completeness of security requirements for e-health system can be developed. in this paper we propose model oriented security requirements engineering (mosre) framework in the early phases of e-health system development, to identify assets, threats and vulnerabilities. this helps in standardizing the security requirements for secure e-health system without any security issues.elicitation of security requirements for e-health system by applying model oriented security requirements engineering (mosre) framework
