in this paper, the complexity of applying a guess and determine attack to so-called linear feedback shift register (lfsr)-based stream ciphers is analyzed. this family of stream ciphers uses a single or several lfsr and a filtering function f : gf(2)n &#8594; gf(2)m to generate the blocks of m &#8805; 1 keystream bits at the time. in difference to a classical guess and determine attack, a method based on guessing certain bits in order to determine the remaining secret key/state bits, our approach efficiently takes advantage of the reduced preimage space for relatively large m and at the same time employing the design structure of the cipher. several variations of the algorithm are derived to circumvent the sensitivity of attack to the input data, n, m and the key length. in certain cases, our attack outperforms classical algebraic attacks [10]; these being considered as one of the most efficient cryptanalyst tools for this type of ciphers. a superior performance of our attack over algebraic attacks is demonstrated in case the filtering function belongs to the extended maiorana-mcfarland class.on guess and determine cryptanalysis of lfsr-based stream ciphers
