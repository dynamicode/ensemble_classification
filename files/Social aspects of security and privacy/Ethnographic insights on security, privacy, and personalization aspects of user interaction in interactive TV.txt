user interaction for interactive tv (itv) services becomes a critical aspect in the design of new itv and internet protocol tv (iptv) offers. new services like social tv, direct image and data up- and download from the set-top box, connectivity of the itv system to the pc and other mobile media devices, pose the question on how to support security, privacy, and personalization. to investigate the (sometimes na&#239;ve) concepts of users of what changes an interactive tv system will bring in terms of security and privacy for their living room behaviors, and how to best support these aspects in the user interaction, an ethnographic study with 40 households (126 participants) was conducted. we investigated users' assumptions and ideas on the concepts of security, privacy and personalization using a combination of playful probing and an interview at the start and the end of the study. findings show that households are not aware of possible problems in terms of security and privacy, before the introduction of interactive tv. this work presents user generated ideas on how to improve security aspects on the tv, user's perception on identification mechanisms for tv services, and summarizes ethnographic insights found in the study.
