recent research on overlay networks has revealed that user-perceived network performance could be improved by an overlay routing mechanism. the effectiveness of overlay routing is mainly a result of the policy mismatch between the overlay routing and the underlay ip routing operated by isps. however, this policy mismatch causes a "free-riding" traffic problem, which may become harmful to the cost structure of internet service providers. in the present paper, we define the free-riding problem in the overlay routing and evaluate the degree of free-riding traffic to reveal the effect of the problem on isps. we introduce a numerical metric to evaluate the degree of the free-riding problem and confirm that most multihop overlay paths that have better performance than the direct path brings the free-riding problem. we also discuss the guidelines for selecting paths that are more effective than the direct path and that mitigate the free-riding problem.evaluation of free-riding traffic problem in overlay routing and its mitigation method
