in recent research it turned out that boolean verification of digital signatures in the context of ws-security is likely to fail: if parts of a soap message are signed and the signature verification applied to the whole document returns true, then nevertheless the document may have been significantly altered.in this paper, we provide a detailed analysis on the possible scenarios that enable these signature wrapping attacks. derived from this analysis, we propose a new solution that uses a subset of xpath instead of id attributes to point to the signed subtree, and show that this solution is both efficient and secure.analysis of signature wrapping attacks and countermeasures
