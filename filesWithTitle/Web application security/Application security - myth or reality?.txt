the security services within applications have received recent attention. it has been suggested that this may be the only way to increase overall information system assurance in an era where ict governance and compliance have taken on new force and the use of commodity level ict products for critical information systems continues. while it has been argued that an application can be no more secure than its underlying computer subsystems, security at the application layer was always envisaged as playing a major role, e.g. in the "open systems interconnection (osi)" security model. at a time when "end-user" programming is being advocated, the needs and parameters of security education and training are rapidly changing, and increased threats from global internet connection are rapidly rising, there is a need to reconsider security schemes at the application level. this paper examines current trends in application design, development, deployment and management and evaluates these against known system vulnerabilities and threats.application security - myth or reality?
