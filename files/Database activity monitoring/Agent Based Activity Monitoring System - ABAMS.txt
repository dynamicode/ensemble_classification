multi-agent system (mas) is a system composed of several agents, collectively capable of achieving goals that are difficult to achieve by an individual agent or monolithic system. mas is ideal for a network-like application for its flexibility, distributed nature, and modifiability, without the need for detailed rewriting of the application. in this paper, we have proposed agent based activity monitoring system (abams) for the monitoring of resources over a network, suitable for network of networks; commonly known as can (campus area network). the system is fully autonomous and once initialized with the given rules and domain knowledge abams manages resources on its own with the help of mobile agents.
