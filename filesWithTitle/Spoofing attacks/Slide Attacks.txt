it is a general belief among the designers of block-ciphers that even a relatively weak cipher may become very strong if its number of rounds is made very large. in this paper we describe a new generic known- (or sometimes chosen-) plaintext attack on product ciphers, which we call the slide attack and which in many cases is independent of the number of rounds of a cipher. we illustrate the power of this new tool by giving practical attacks on several recently designed ciphers: treyfer, wake-rofb, and variants of des and blowfish.slide attacks
