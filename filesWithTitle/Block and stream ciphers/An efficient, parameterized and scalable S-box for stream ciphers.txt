in stream ciphers, the ratio of performance to the security is the most important issue. however, the s-boxes used in a stream cipher can become a bottleneck of speed due to use of large memory, difficulty in hardware realization and more processing. this paper proposes an s-box construction that is easy to implement both in hardware and software. the proposed s-box is efficient in speed, parameterized and scalable with excellent security properties. it also provides a designer with the flexibility to trade-off among speed, area and the security properties. the security analysis has been performed on the s-box. the security properties are found to be comparable with the existing standards.an efficient, parameterized and scalable s-box for stream ciphers
