in this paper we present a new kind of cryptanalytic attack which utilizes bugs in the hardware implementation of computer instructions. the best known example of such a bug is the intel division bug, which resulted in slightly inaccurate results for extremely rare inputs. whereas in most applications such bugs can be viewed as a minor nuisance, we show that in the case of rsa (even when protected by oaep), pohlig-hellman, elliptic curve cryptography, and several other schemes, such bugs can be a security disaster: decrypting ciphertexts on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;computer which multiplies &lt;em&gt;even one pair of numbers&lt;/em&gt;incorrectly can lead to full leakage of the secret key, sometimes with a single well-chosen ciphertext.
