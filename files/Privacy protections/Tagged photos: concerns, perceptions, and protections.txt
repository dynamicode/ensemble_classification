photo sharing has become a popular feature of many online social networking sites. many of the photo sharing applications on these sites, allow users to annotate photos with those who are in them. a number of researchers have examined the social uses and privacy issues of online photo sharing sites, but few have explored the privacy issues of photo sharing in social networks. in this paper, we begin by examining some of our findings from a series of focus groups on photo privacy in the social networking domain. we then devise a new mechanism to enhance photo privacy based on these findings.
