this paper addresses a problem that has arisen in building distributed systems in which incomplete tmst exists and program composition is necessary. the problem is to permit authentication for both access control and accounting when cascading invocations. the problem can be identified as one of providing cascaded authentication. we have developed a mechanism we call passports that are passed along with each stage of the cascade and digitally signed at each transition. the information thus signed is that which is critical to the authentication. the contributions of the work are both in recognizing the problem and in devising a solution that is efficient enough to be usable, although there will be some cost associated with such a mechanism.
