this paper reports a cryptosystem designed forsecurity of embedded systems. it is based on the theoryof cellular automata(ca). the cellular automata basedcryptosystem(cac) employs a series of transforms - simple,moderatel complex, complex - all generated with differentclasses of ca. the code size of cac can be found tobe lesser than that of an other scheme published in the literature.cryptanalysis of the proposed scheme is reportedalong with similar analysis for two popular systems - desand aes. experimental results confirm that the security ofthe system is significantly better than des and comparableto that of aes. hardware-soft are co-design of cacwith a simple ca hardware is also reported to establish theefficiency in terms of small code size and high speed of execution.cryptosystem designed for embedded system security
