embedding computers into our environment is perhaps not only a job for computer scientist and engineers. we propose to understand the computer as a material for design as means to invite artists, architect, and designers to participate in envisioning how and where the computational power can be used. we will invite the conference attendees to (once again) think about how to bridge the so-called gap between computational and material properties but this time using a material rather than the traditional information centric perspective. the invitation is extended through hands-on experiences with our two samples of computational composites.material computing: computing materials
