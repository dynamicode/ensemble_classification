information security is very important nowadays. every it system needs protection mechanisms for stability and safety of work. to solve this task, there are proposed a variety of security-providing solutions, but most of them are very expensive and non-systematic. the paper discusses up-to-date techniques implemented for security aims and addresses to the technique of security control based on settings monitoring of variable program components of the trusted information environment. there is proposed a formal basis of security control based on finding the security settings which provide the system with stability and integrity. the specified technique allows proposing a schema of dynamic security and integrity control system which provides an automated process of security assurance and management. these security control technique and system extend security-relevant approaches making security reachable, permanent, and effective.permanent protection of information systems with method of automated security and integrity control
