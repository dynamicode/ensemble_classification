in previous work we have presented the zenturio experimentmanagement system for performance and parameterstudies of parallel and distributed applications on clusterand grid architectures. in this paper we describe experiencesof an on-going work, targeting the implementationof zenturio on top of the open grid services architecture(ogsa). we analyse the opportunities offered by aweb services toolkit to develop grid services as required byogsa and compare them with the solutions offered by theopen grid services infrastructure (ogsi) specification. issuesregarding proxy management, service lifecycle, uddiservice repository, firewall management, factory and registryservices, service throughput, and security are comparativelyanalysed in both implementations.from web services to ogsa: experiences in implementing an ogsa-based grid application
