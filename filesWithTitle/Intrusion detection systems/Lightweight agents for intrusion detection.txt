we have designed and implemented an intrusion detection system (ids) prototype based on mobile agents. our agents travel between monitored systems in a network of distributed systems, obtain information from data cleaning agents, classify and correlate information, and report the information to a user interface and database via mediators.agent systems with lightweight agent support allow runtime addition of new capabilities to agents. we describe the design of our multi-agent ids and show how lightweight agent capabilities allowed us to add communication and collaboration capabilities to the mobile agents in our ids.lightweight agents for intrusion detection
