the paper deals with the modification made to the general electrospinning setup. the emphasis is given to characterize the designs based on their applicability. four basic categories are identified, namely, patterned fibers, fiber yarns, multicomponent, and deposition area of the fiber mat obtained. the mathematical modeling to better understand the physics behind the modification made to the general electrospinning setup is presented. emphasis is given to critically analyse these categories on the basis of the applications served by them. each of these categories is found to serve a specific poll of advanced application enabling the researchers to make a calculated choice for the design of the electrospinning setup for particular application.
