by carefully measuring the amount of time required tm perform private key operalions, attackers may be able to find fixed diffie-hellman exponents, factor rsa keys, and break other cryptosystems. against, a valnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext. actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements. techniques for preventing the attack for rsa and diffie-hellman are presented. some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevenl timing attacks.timing attacks on implementations of diffie-hellman, rsa, dss, and other systems
