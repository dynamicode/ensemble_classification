the paper reviews different approaches applied to enable security in grid systems. it analyzes security mechanisms compatible with grid platforms. it focuses on the following aspects of grid security: anomaly detection and security policy verification. petri-net-based model is proposed for access control security analysis in grid systems. that model enhances grid security with trusted 'jobs' submission and security verification.
