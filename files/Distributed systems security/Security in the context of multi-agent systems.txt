security of systems and information has always been a challenge to organisations and industries. many technical solutions including firewalls, encryption and anti-virus software have been used, yet security still remains a problem. these security solutions failures are largely due to the fact that as systems become more complex, a lot of interaction is involved between various actors. some of these interactions usually leave room for security vulnerabilities which are simply not accounted for by the technical security solutions: there are just too many possibilities. my research is focused on this aspect of organisational security. the proposed approach to this involves the monitoring of events for traces of behaviours that may eventually circumvent the security regulations of the organisation. the methodology includes organisational modeling and simulation of self monitoring agents using a normative framework.
