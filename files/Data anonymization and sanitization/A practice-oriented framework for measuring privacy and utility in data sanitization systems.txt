published data is prone to privacy attacks. sanitization methods aim to prevent these attacks while maintaining usefulness of the data for legitimate users. quantifying the trade-off between usefulness and privacy of published data has been the subject of much research in recent years. we propose a pragmatic framework for evaluating sanitization systems in real-life and use data mining utility as a universal measure of usefulness and privacy. we propose a definition for data mining utility that can be tuned to capture the needs of data users and the adversaries' intentions in a setting that is specified by a database, a candidate sanitization method, and privacy and utility concerns of data owner. we use this framework to evaluate and compare privacy and utility offered by two well-known sanitization methods, namely k-anonymity and &#949;-differential privacy, when uci's "adult" dataset and the weka data mining package is used, and utility and privacy measures are defined for users and adversaries. in the case of k-anonymity, we compare our results with the recent work of brickell and shmatikov (kdd 2008), and show that using data mining algorithms increases their proposed adversarial gains.
