the digital watermark technology and the mobile agent technology play significant roles in the industrial applications in tandem with each other. in recent years, the union of the mobile agent technology and the watermark technology has been intensively investigated. a new architecture is proposed using this integration technology to protect copyright by detecting the watermark on the internet. this architecture comprises four integral blocks: author block (ab), user block (ub), watermark agent block (wab) and mobile agent block (mab). in ab, author embeds his ownership watermark in his work and then registers the same in copyright management server (cms). then cms embeds the second watermark in the digital work produced by watermark agent. this is actually a hidden agent. in ub, user submits detail information about personality and digital work to cms. cms gives user the digital work and user key according to the input information. wab creates the custom-built watermark agents and designs the route strategy. in mab, the watermark agents are dispatched to the suspicious hosts by wab and are examined for their copyright.digital rights management using mobile agents
