while hardware design focuses on creating minimally-sized circuits, this paper proposes that security-centric designs require a departure from this mentality. the need for built-in protection mechanisms at all levels of design is paramount to providing cost-effective secure systems. we focus on the high-level design of sequential circuits by targeting finite state machines (fsms) and their vulnerability to non-invasive, side channel based, attacks. the unconventional paradigm shift needed is justified by showing that conventional, minimalism-based, fsm synthesis and encodings allow direct correlation between state/transitions and hamming models. a two-fold method, involving structural modifications and specific encoding strategies, is proposed for side-channel secure fsm (s*fsms). preliminary high-level simulations show the effectiveness and potential for security driven s*fsm synthesis methods to mitigate the relationship between attack models and underlying hardware implementations.s*fsm: a paradigm shift for attack resistant fsm designs and encodings
