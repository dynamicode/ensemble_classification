social web has changed the concept of leisure time. as a result street neighbors have been replaced by e-neighbors and walls have become e-walls to share ideas and gossips. despite so many advantages we cannot ignore potential threats to user privacy and security. in order to be extremely usable, such systems should have strict security and privacy policies in place. in this paper the authors focus on "facebook" to understand privacy and security problems by carrying out a web based survey. based on the findings from empirical data the authors propose different enhancements for the improvement of user privacy and potential threats to user account security.
