computers, like cars, are often at least half empty, and this observation led to the latest big idea in it. if idle compute cycles and empty storage systems could be exploited, there would be a huge new source of processing power that could be tapped, particularly by smaller enterprises that could not afford equivalent it resources of their own. the big hurdle is security, given that the idea of grid computing is to range outside your domain to find capacity to run applications that may involve confidential data and put intellectual property at risk.
