we describe two variants of ecdsa one of which is secure, in the random oracle model, against existential forgery but suffers from the notion of duplicate signatures. the second variant is also secure against existential forgery but we argue that it is likely to possess only four natural duplicate signatures. our variants of ecdsa are analogous to the variants of dsa as proposed by brickell et al. however, we show that the ecdsa variants have better exact security properties.
