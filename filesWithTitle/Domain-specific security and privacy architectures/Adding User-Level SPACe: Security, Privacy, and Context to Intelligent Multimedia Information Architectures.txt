we provide a unified architecture, called space, for secure, privacy-aware, and contextual multimedia systems in organizations. many key and important architectural components already exist which contribute to a unified platform, including the classic data mining, security, and privacy-preserving components in conventional intelligent systems. after presenting an overview of our unified architecture, we focus on the state-of-the-art architectural components for user interaction in future systems - particularly multimedia voice interaction with intelligent systems. this paper shows how user-level conversational data mining (cdm) methods, coupled with biometric security, and enhanced with privacy- awareness, may be used with any web information system architecture. finally, we provide an example of our unified architecture through integrating a knowledge architecture for an e-finance application in the financial services domain. the resulting architectures benefit from added security, privacy-awareness, and contextual filtering at the user-level.adding user-level space: security, privacy, and context to intelligent multimedia information architectures
