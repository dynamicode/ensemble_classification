we develop a novel technique for authenticating physical documentsby using random, naturally occurring imperfections in paper texture.to this end, we devised a new method for measuring thethree-dimensional surface of a paper without modifying the documentin any way, using only a commodity scanner.from this physicalfeature, we generate a concise fingerprint that uniquely identifiesthe document.our method is secure against counterfeiting, robustto harsh handling, and applicable even before any content is printedon a page.it has a wide range of applications, including detectingforged currency and tickets, authenticating passports, and haltingcounterfeit goods.on a more sinister note, document identificationcould be used to de-anonymize printed surveys and to compromise thesecrecy of paper ballots.fingerprinting blank paper using commodity scanners
