in this paper, we present a framework for reverse engineeringallowing the integration and interaction of differentanalysis and visualization tools. the framework architecturethat we propose uses a dynamic type system to guaranteethe proper exchange of data between the tools and aset of wrapper classes to handle their communication. thisallows for an easy and secure integration of tools that haveoriginally not been designed to work together. in this sense,existing tools can be (re-)used and integrated. as a proofof concept we also present our own instantiation of the proposedframework architecture.reuse in reverse engineering
