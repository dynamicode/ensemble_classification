web applications are important, ubiquitous distributed systems whose current security relies primarily on server-side mechanisms. this paper makes the end-to-end argument that the client and server must collaborate to achieve security goals, to eliminate common security exploits, and to secure the emerging class of rich, cross-domain web applications referred to as web 2.0. in order to support end-to-end security, web clients must be enhanced. we introduce mutation-event transforms: an easy-to-use client-side mechanism that can enforce even fine-grained, application-specific security policies, and whose implementation requires only straightforward changes to existing web browsers. we give numerous examples of attractive, new security policies that demonstrate the advantages of end-to-end web application security and of our proposed mechanism.
