the sensitivities of the bits of low weight codewords inturbo codes to noises are discussed firstly and theresult is that the lower weight the higher sensitivity.theoretical analysis shows that through the protectionson such key-bits which have high sensitivities; theminimal weight of the codes can be improvedapparently. the simulations also give out the supportedresults: the ber could be highly improved at higheb/n0 for code rates both 1/3 and 1/2.the key-bits in turbo codes and their protections
