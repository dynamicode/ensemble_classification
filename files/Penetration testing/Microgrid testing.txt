with the publication of ieee 1574.4 guide for design, operation, and integration of distributed resource island systems with electric power systems, there is an increasing amount of attention on not only the design and operations of microgrids, but also on the proper operation and testing of these systems. this standard provides alternative approaches and good practices for the design, operation, and integration of microgrids. this includes the ability to separate from and reconnect to part of the utility grid while providing power to the islanded power system. this presentation addresses the industry need to develop standardized testing and evaluation procedures for microgrids in order to assure quality operation in the grid connected and islanded modes of operation.
