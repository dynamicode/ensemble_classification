modern critical infrastructures have command and control systems. these command and control systems are commonly called supervisory control and data acquisition (scada). in the past, scada system has a closed operational environment, so these systems were designed without security functionality. nowadays, as a demand for connecting the scada system to the open network growths, the study of scada system security is an issue. a key-management scheme is critical for securing scada communications. numerous key-management structures for scada also have been suggested. 11770-2 mechanism 9 key establishment protocol has been used in scada communication however a security proof for the 11770-2 mechanism 9 protocol is needed. the purpose of this paper is to provide a general overview about scada system, and its related security issues. furthermore, we try to investigate the importance of key management protocol and the need of formal security poof.scada system security, complexity, and security proof
