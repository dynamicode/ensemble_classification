lossy trapdoor functions (ltfs) was introduced by peikert and waters in 2008. the importance of the ltfs was justified by their numerous cryptographic applications, like the construction of injective one-way trapdoor functions, cca-secure public-key encryption, etc. however, little research on application of ltfs to key-leakage resilient public-key encryption was done. in this article we introduce a new variant of ltfs featuring leakage-resilience, namely lrltfs and give a realization of lrltfs with leakage rate 1/&#920;(&#954;) (where &#954; is the security parameter) under the decisional diffie-hellman (ddh) assumption. we further improve the leakage rate to 1-o(1) over a composite-order group in which the decisional composite residuosity (dcr) assumption holds. we also introduce a new notion of key-leakage attacks, which we call weak key-leakage attacks, for bridging the adaptive and non-adaptive key-leakage attacks in the setting of public-key cryptosystem. in this model, the leakage adversary only gets a part of public key before accessing to a leakage oracle. we show that lrltfs imply public-key encryption schemes secure against chosen-ciphertext weak key-leakage attacks in a black-box sense.
