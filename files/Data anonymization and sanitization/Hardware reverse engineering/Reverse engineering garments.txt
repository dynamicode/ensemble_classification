segmenting garments from humanoid meshes or point clouds is a challenging problem with applications in the textile industry and in model based motion capturing. in this work we present a physically based template-matching technique for the automatic extraction of garment dimensions from 3d meshes or point clouds of dressed humans. the successfull identification of garment dimensions also allows the semantic segmentation of the mesh into naked and dressed parts.
