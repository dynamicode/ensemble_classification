we present tool-support for checking uml models and c code against security requirements. a framework supports implementing verification routines, based on xmi output of the diagrams from uml case tools, and on control flow generated from the c code. the tool also supports weaving security aspects into the code generated from the models. advanced users can use this open-source framework to implement verification routines for the constraints of self-defined security requirements. we focus on a verification routine that automatically verifies crypto-based software for security requirements by using automated theorem provers.tools for model-based security engineering
