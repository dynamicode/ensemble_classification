sometimes it is worthwhile to view college and university computing centers as an outsider. it is amazing that between large and small, public and private, one sees many similarities. most colleges and universities have their own hardware or access to computing power from a local network. there are statistical and graphical packages to maintain, documentation to write and maintain, users to consult with on a first come/first serve basis and at a higher level, reading rooms and bookstores. there are many common software products such as basic, fortran (including watfiv), pl/i, spss, apl, the biomedical data programs, imsl, calcomp, and of course star trek. in 1974, i had the opportunity to participate in a working group considering the issue of future services of university computing centers at the conference for academic computing center directors, snowmass, colorado. that working group left a lasting impression on me. recently, i have spent many restless hours assembling my ideas of the future in computing services at my own institution and then planning the orchestration of the changes.
