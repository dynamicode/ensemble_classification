security assessment is largely ad hoc today due to its inherent complexity. the existing methods are typically experimental in nature highly dependent of the assessor's experience, and the security metrics are usually qualitative. we propose to address the dual problems of experimental analysis and qualitative metrics by developing two complementary approaches for security assessment: (1) analytical modeling, and (2) metrics-based assessment. to avoid experimental evaluation, we put forward a formal model that permits the accurate and scientific analysis of different security attributes and security flaws. to avoid qualitative metrics leading to ambiguous conclusions, we put forward a collection of mathematical formulas based on which quantitative metrics can be derived. the vulnerability analysis model responses to the need for a theoretical foundation for modeling information security, and security metrics are the cornerstone of risk analysis and security management. in addition to the security analysis approach, we discuss security testing methods as well. a relative complete coverage (rcc) principle is proposed along with an example of applying the rcc principle. the innovative ideas proposed in this paper include a hierarchical multi-level modeling approach to modeling vulnerability using model composition and refinement techniques, a data-centric, quantitative metrics mechanism, and multidimensional assessment capturing both process and product elements in a formalized framework.information security models and metrics
